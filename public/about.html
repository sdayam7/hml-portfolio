<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I am Shruti Dayam! Born and raised in the vibrant city of Hyderabad, India. I am proud to call the south my home, with Telugu as my mother tongue
  As the eldest daughter in my family, I am incredibly grateful to my parents for their endless support, especially when I decided to pursue my dreams abroad.

<p>Art has always been my first love—whether it’s painting, sketching, or simply playing with colors, it feels like food for my soul. 
  If math hadn’t swooped in and stolen the show, I might’ve ended up as a painter.<br/>
  My love for math eventually led me to engineering. I ventured into mechanical engineering, inspired by my love for Iron Man and the coolness of robotics. 
  It was exciting—at first. But by my second semester, I realized it wasn’t where I wanted to be long-term. 
  I still loved problem-solving and being creative, but I wanted to work in a field where I could combine both. 
  That’s when I discovered web development—a perfect mix of logic and creativity.

<p>After earning my bachelor’s, I took online courses to deepen my skills. But I also wanted to live life to the fullest—YOLO, right?
  So, I packed my bags, crossed oceans, and landed in the USA to pursue a master’s in computer science.<br />
  Now, I’m working toward becoming a web developer, blending creativity, problem-solving, and my love for building something meaningful.
